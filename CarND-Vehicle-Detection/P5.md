### Project 5

---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Explain how you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in the 4th code cell `Object Detection Framework..` under `get_hog_features`of the IPython notebook.  

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  
These datasets are comprised of 
 images taken from the [GTI vehicle image database](http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html) and 
 [KITTI vision benchmark suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/).
Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

To optimize the HoG extraction, I extracted the HoG feature for the entire image only once. Then the entire HoG image is saved for further processing.

#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I tried various combinations of parameters and and settled on the following combination: `Object Detection Framework..`
* `YCrCb` color space
* orient = 9  # HOG orientations
* pix_per_cell = 8 # HOG pixels per cell
* cell_per_block = 2 # HOG cells per block, which can handel e.g. shadows
* hog_channel = "ALL" # Can be 0, 1, 2, or "ALL"
* spatial_size = (32, 32) # Spatial binning dimensions
* hist_bins = 32    # Number of histogram bins
* spatial_feat = True # Spatial features on or off
* hist_feat = True # Histogram features on or off
* hog_feat = True # HOG features on or off

All the features are normalized, otherwise the classifier 
may have some bias toward to the features with higher weights.

#### 3. Describe how  you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features.

I trained a linear SVM by randomly selecting 20% of the images for testing and others for training, and a linear SVM is used as classifier `#Threshold for color and gradient thresholding`

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Describe how you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I used two scales of the search window (64x64 and 128x128, see line 41) and search only between [400, 656] in y axis `# Min and max in y to search in slide_window()`. I choose 75% overlap for the search windows in each scale.

For every window, the SVM classifier is used to predict whether it contains a vehicle nor not. If yes, save this window. In the end, a list of windows containing detected vehicles is obtained.

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  

Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video 
Here's a [link to my video result](.output_images/full_output_project_video.mp4)


#### 2. Describe how you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are two frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  

The accuracy is alright, but the speed (2 fps) is an problem due to the fact of sliding window approach, it's really time consuming. I could use image downsampling, multi-threads, or GPU processing to improve the speed. But there are there is a lot of work to be done to make it running real-time. Also, in this application, I limit the vertical searching range to control the number of searching windows, as well as avoid some false positives (e.g. cars on the tree).
